# The Plain
Final Project for Programming Foundations

## Introduction
This program consists on emulating a plain with an ecosystem where animals move, eat, reproduce and die. Since no classes are used, abstract data types are used instead that should be used to manipulate the needed information during the emulation, as well as a set of additional functions.
